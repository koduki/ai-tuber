# Agent Rules

1. **Language**: All interactions, source code comments, and documentation must be in **Japanese**.
2. **Context**: This project is an "AI Tuber" system governed by the Saint Graph (Brain) and acting via the Body (MCP).
3. **Commit Style**: Use conventional commits (feat, fix, docs, chore).
