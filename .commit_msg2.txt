docs: add architecture design principles to documentation

Reflect core refactoring concepts from implementation_plan:

1. Code/Data Separation - Treat Mind (characters) as data
2. Stateless Containers - No user-specific info in images
3. Platform Abstraction - Unified local/GCP experience

Changes:
- Add "Architecture Design Principles" section to overview.md
- Add design principles to README.md features
- Enhance prompt_loader.py and config.py descriptions with architecture context
